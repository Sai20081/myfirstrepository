    <h2>Mediator</h2>

    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. They happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them. Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help.</p>
