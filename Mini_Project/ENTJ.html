        ENTJ is a personality type defined by the Myers Briggs-Type
         Indicator (MBTI) test as Extraversion (E), Intuition (I),
         Thinking (T), and Judgment (J). Someone with an ENTJ personality
         is otherwise known as The Commander and belongs to a very rare
          segment of the population. ENTJs think a lot about the future,
           which is why it makes sense that they are also known to be
            detailed planners. They find comfort in having a sense of
             predictability and control and tend to be very logical and objective when forming decisions. While they do enjoy socializing – and are very adept at it, thanks to their strong verbal and interaction skills – they tend to hide their emotions because they believe it’s a weakness. Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle.
