    <h2>Logisticians</h2>
   <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This personality type tends to be loyal, patient and practical. They often have a strong sense of duty and are dutiful citizens. ISTJ people also tend to be traditionalists who value family, both immediate and extended. Working with clear processes and systems is important to ISTJs. They like things to be well-organized and want everyone to play by the rules. This personality type also takes their commitments very seriously and is often reliable employees or citizens. While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, Virtuosos are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies. Logisticians aren’t known for expressing their emotions readily, but that doesn’t mean that people with this personality type don’t feel frustration or resentment when they’re pulling more than their weight. And unless they make sure that their relationships are balanced and sustainable, Logisticians may end up compromising the very stability that they feel called to protect. The good news is that, by learning to set appropriate boundaries and speak up when they’re overstretched, Logisticians can offer the world the full benefit of their many gifts, including their clarity, their loyalty, and their dependability.</p>
