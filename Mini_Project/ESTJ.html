    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are looking for an example of someone with the ESTJ personality, you aren't as likely to find them working at the local tree nursery or library.  This strong personality is often drawn to positions in politics, high-ranking military roles, or running large corporations. Many judges also share the same traits. Interestingly, very few musicians or music artists have this personality type. For people drawn to television, you are more likely to see news commentators or talk show hosts than reporters of current events. ESTJ personality types don't give respect merely because they are told they should. They believe respect is earned through hard work. They can't stand laziness or signs of entitlement. Decisive individuals, they make taking control seem like the easiest possible thing. Rarely do these individuals act until they have all the facts and everything in order. Spontaneity isn't one of their traits. In some cases, this personality type can carry their naturally assertive personality too far and become aggressive. They may also become overly ambitious, causing them to veer off course and get into shady areas. For the most part, however, the extremes of these traits are kept in check because of the high moral values and respect for tradition.</p>
