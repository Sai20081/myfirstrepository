   <h2>The Defender</h2>
   <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The ISFJ personality type is “The Defender.” ISFJs are known for their loyalty, compassion, and organizational skills. They have solid family ties and won't hesitate to fight for them. In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go around. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders’ sense of loyalty doesn’t stop with their nearest and dearest – it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to serve can have its downsides. For Defenders, “good enough” is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. Although they’re Introverted, Defenders have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people’s lives, Defenders have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that they show up for other people, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world.</p>
