    <h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted, Observant, Thinking, and Prospecting
        personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever
        is in front of them. They love uncovering lifeâ€™s opportunities, whether socializing with others
        or in more personal pursuits. Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings.
         Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. Entrepreneurs are the likeliest personality
         type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action. Entrepreneurs
          have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Entrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go.
