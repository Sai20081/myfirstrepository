    <h2>Avocate</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; INFJs are often called “the counselor” or “the protector.” They are creative, gentle and caring people. INFJs are good at seeing the big picture and understanding complex ideas. They are often attracted to carrier in arts, writing, counseling or politics. INFJs are known for their deep relationships with a few close friends. They are also known for their strong intuition and for being able to see the potential in people. INFJs often have a strong sense of justice and are determined to make the world a better place. Many INFJs see helping others as their mission in life, and they’re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. At times, however, Protectors may focus so intently on their ideals that they don’t take adequate care of themselves – a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout.
