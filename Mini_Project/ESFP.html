    <h2>Entertainer</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An Entertainer (ESFP) is a person with the Extraverted, Observant, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities. If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. Entertainers love the spotlight, and all the world’s a stage. Many famous people with the Entertainer personality type are indeed actors. ESFPs have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, Entertainer personalities have an eye for fashion.  Entertainers are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease. The biggest challenge Entertainers face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Entertainers are welcome wherever there’s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun.
