    <h2>Consuls</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        One of the sixteen personality types defined by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is ESFJ. They are also called Consul. It stands for Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, judging. They like to be in control and are decisive and opinionated. People with this type of personality like to be around people and be the center of attention. Consuls are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. And Consuls believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, Consuls may find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, Consuls often struggle to accept it when someone – particularly someone they care about – disagrees with them. With their love of order and structure, Consuls prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers – and they’re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they may take it personally when someone doesn’t seem to appreciate their efforts.</p>
