    <h2>Adventurer</h2>
    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
        ISFP's don't feel the need to be like others, and are very creative, free-spirited, and visual. They are independent, have a hands-on approach to learning and life… and can be very competitive. ISFPs accept people for who they are. They are thoughtful, easy-going, friendly, loyal, and charismatic… making them great confidantes. Since they're also introverts, they tend to be quiet and reserved, have a small circle of a few close friends and need time alone to recharge after social events. They're sensitive and kind. ISFPs are in touch with their feelings and have an appreciation for nature. They enjoy working with animals and being outside. Of course, they prefer jobs where they have autonomy or freedom, and can work independently. Because of their focus on the present, they're drawn to careers where they can address real-world issues.</p>
