    <h2>Debater</h2>
    <P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ENTP, also known as the debater among the Mbti, isn’t
        afraid to disagree upon other’s statements. In fact,
        they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything
         or anyone. You would be wrong if u think ENTPs are
         rebelliousor mean-spirited. Instead, they pretty much have playful
        sense of humor, knowledgeable and high curiosity. They may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good. Debaters usually spend too much energy wasting on “winning” argument with others. Overall, ENTPs are generally loyal and sacrificing for the ones they love.
